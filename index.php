    <h1>Laptop Database</h1>
    <p>Here you can find a label for each laptop</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brand Model Number</li>
        <li>Battery, Special Features (GPU, 360, TouchScreen, ETC.)</li>
        <li>Ram / Storage size and type</li>
        <li>CPU Type</li>
        <li>CPU Speed / Cores</li>
        <li>Bios: state(Locked, Unlocked), OS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Laptop Spare Parts</h2>
    <p>Here I need to find what kind of parts the Laptop can take. I only really need to know the ram type it uses and
        the Battery</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM Type</li>
        <li>Battery</li>
        <li>A/C Adapter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I envision all the dofferent point of data that would be nice to know, like the ammount of ports, their types and
        speeds. and IDK, some other important data points, like wifi cards, or other batteries that might be compatible.
        This is not important right now.</p>
    <p>Right now I just need to get the laptop labels done.</p>
    <p>and a way to keep them together. and easily accessible, without the need to create more than one.</p>
    <p>and a way to search though all the fuzz.</p>
    <p>and a way to Add, Edit, and Delete</p>
